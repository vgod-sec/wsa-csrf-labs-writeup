# Lab: CSRF where token validation depends on request method

This lab demonstrates a misconfigured CSRF defense where token validation is only enforced on certain HTTP methods (e.g., POST), allowing attackers to bypass the protection by switching to a method like GET.

**üß™ Lab Credentials:**  
Username: `wiener`  
Password: `peter`

---

## ‚úÖ Goal  
Exploit the CSRF vulnerability by crafting a GET request that changes the victim‚Äôs email address without triggering token validation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation Steps

1. Log in with `wiener:peter` and go to the "My Account" page.
2. Change your own email and intercept the request in Burp Suite.
3. Send the captured POST request to **Burp Repeater**.
4. Modify the request method from POST to **GET** using the ‚ÄúChange request method‚Äù option.
5. Remove the CSRF token from the request and test if it still works ‚Äî you‚Äôll notice the CSRF token is no longer required for GET requests.
6. Copy the request URL with the updated parameters (email) and create the following HTML exploit:

```html
<img src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=attacker@evil.com">
```
7. Go to the **Exploit Server** provided in the lab interface.
8. In the "Body" section, paste the following HTML exploit payload:

```html
<img src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=csrfvictim@evil.com">
```
9. Click **View exploit** to test the payload on yourself.  
   - If your email changes to `csrfvictim@evil.com`, the exploit works successfully.

10. Change the email in the payload to ensure it does **not match your own account email**.

11. Click **Deliver to victim** to send the exploit and complete the lab.
12. ## üí• Impact
- Allows attackers to bypass CSRF protection by switching request method to GET.
- Enables unauthorized actions like changing user email without a valid token.

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation
- Enforce CSRF token validation on **all** HTTP methods.
- Block sensitive actions via **GET**; use POST with token checks.
- Use `SameSite` cookies and validate `Origin`/`Referer` headers.
